# cd2030.vaxx 2.0.3

* The denominator options read "ANC1 population growth" and "Penta1 population growth" (`anc1derived`,
  `penta1derived`), the labels of cd2030.core's data dictionary. Requires cd2030.core 1.3.1.

# cd2030.vaxx 2.0.2

* "Get help" opens the app guide's pages and sections after the docs reorganisation (`apps/countdown/...`).
* Requires cd2030.core 1.3.0 and datasuite.ui 0.3.0 (the working Ask AI buttons, the AI's confirmations).

# cd2030.vaxx 2.0.1

Documentation only; no change to the app.

* A README: what the app does, installing and running it (`run_app()` arguments and the `CDSUITE_SHINY_*` variables),
  its files, developing and releasing it.

# cd2030.vaxx 2.0.0

* First release as an installable package: `cd2030.vaxx::run_app()` starts the app.
* Built on cd2030.core (>= 1.1.0) and datasuite.ui (>= 0.1.0); the shared Countdown pages, report builder and
  translations now come from those packages instead of copied code.
* R CMD check passes with no errors, warnings or notes.
